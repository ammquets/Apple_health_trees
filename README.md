# Observations from Apple health data using three tree-based models

This work was submitted as my senior project at College of the Atlantic, and the repository has been archived. 

For this project I accessed my Apple health data and applied three different types of tree-based models with the goals of learning about new machine learning methods and producing a product that might help others to learn these methods too. The models that I worked with were decision trees, the random forest algorithm, and gradient boosting machines. I primarily focused on predicting weekends and weekdays from variables related to my walking and running distances and speeds. All three models predicted weekends with low accuracy, usually just over 50%, which indicates to me that I donâ€™t change my walking and running behavior based on whether it is a weekend or a weekday. I also applied a random forest to these data to try to predict whether observations occurred during the pandemic or not, which resulted in a much higher accuracy. Included in this project are the write-up, my raw Apple health data export, and a clean and documented R markdown script.
